= Image generator container

This container image is used to randomly select *normal* (80%) and *pneumonia risk* (20%) images from a *source* bucket, and copy them to a *destination* bucket.
Note: the code uses OpenShift Container Storage compatible APIs since OpenShift Container Storage Bucket objects are used in the demo. Adapting to AWS buckets may require some updates.

Required environment variables are: +
*Object storage*

* `access_key`: S3 storage access key
* `secret_key`: S3 storage secret key
* `service_point`: S3 storage endpoint, http(s)://myendpoint.address

*Buckets*

* `bucket_source`: name of the source bucket
* `bucket_destination`: name of the destination bucket

*Delay between images*

* `seconds_wait`: number of seconds to wait between each image. This can be less than 1 second, e.g. `0.2`
